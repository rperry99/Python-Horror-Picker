# Horror Movie Picker
Don't know what horror movie to watch next? Let me help!

## Phase 1
- Nothing really noteworthy. Set up the program, and made a list of 4 movies, and have the program spit out a random one from the list.

## Phase 2
- Added Numpy
- Made the list of horror movies a list of lists. Each movie has a subgenre attached to it. For now this subgenre doesn't do anything.

## Phase 3
- The horror movie array now gets shuffled
- It takes the user input and loops through the array of arrays. If it can find the user's entry in the array, then it will spit out that movie. 
- If it can't find it, the user will be told that it isn't in the array.
